**SignSpeak AI** is a real-time, AI-powered sign language interpreter that translates sign language into spoken/written text and vice-versa. What sets it apart is its ability to perceive and convey the emotional nuances of the conversation, ensuring that the tone and feeling behind the words are not lost in translation.

## üåü Key Features

* **Real-Time Two-Way Translation**: Translates sign language (ASL, BSL, etc.) to text/speech and text/speech back to a signing avatar.
* **Emotion Recognition**: Utilizes facial expression analysis and body language cues to detect the user's emotional state (e.g., happy, sad, urgent, questioning).
* **Emotionally-Aware Synthesis**:
    * When translating *from* sign language, the output text is annotated with the detected emotion (e.g., *"I need help (urgent)"*).
    * The synthesized voice output reflects the appropriate tone.
    * The signing avatar conveys the correct facial expressions when translating *to* sign language.
* **Cross-Platform**: Accessible via web browser, desktop application, and mobile app.
* **Extensible Dictionary**: Users can contribute new signs and regional dialects to improve the model's accuracy and vocabulary.

## ü§î The "Emotionally Aware" Difference

Traditional translation tools focus on literal meaning, often missing the rich, non-verbal context that is crucial in human communication. Sign language is especially rich in this context, using facial expressions and body posture to convey tone, ask questions, or show emphasis.

SignSpeak AI addresses this by using a multi-modal approach:

1.  **Hand/Body Tracking**: A computer vision model (`MediaPipe`, `OpenCV`) tracks key points on the hands, body, and face.
2.  **Sign Recognition**: A deep learning model (e.g., `LSTM`, `Transformer`) interprets the sequence of key points as signs.
3.  **Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)**: A separate convolutional neural network (`CNN`) analyzes the user's facial landmarks to classify their emotion.
4.  **Contextual Synthesis**: The outputs from the sign recognition and FER models are combined to generate a translation that includes both the *message* and the *feeling*.

For example, the same sign for "thank you" can be polite, heartfelt, or sarcastic. SignSpeak AI aims to capture and convey that difference.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Backend**: Python (Flask / FastAPI)
* **AI / Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, MediaPipe
* **Frontend (Web)**: React / Vue.js, Three.js (for avatar)
* **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB
* **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS / GCP
